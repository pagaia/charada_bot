# charada_bot
This is a telegram bot using the @telegraf nodejs library to search and read poems avaialable also on my blog https://charada.wordpress.com

Actually  articles are not read from the blog directly, but they have been imported into a google spreadsheet.
This simple telegram bot is inspired to [favolealtelefonobot](https://github.com/piersoft/favolealtelefonobot) created by [@piersoft](https://github.com/piersoft/)
I can use then the spreadsheet as a database and execute my queries to find the articles using the [Google Visualization API Query Language](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage)

Feel free to reuse this example for any different purpose.
